# Bateson
A framework integrating number-theoretic resonance (π, φ, primes) with graph-based information processing and meta-cognitive learning. It models emergent computation through dynamic thresholds, self-referential loops, temporal memory, and energy-aware, provenance-tracked autonomous cycles.
